Code is mostly from https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification but
I added some code to predict single images and changed the model slightly.

# Usage
First run '''
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
''' 
or 
'''
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
'''
To predict on single images run predict.py.
The single images must have white or black background.
